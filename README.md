Each year, a company asks us to fill out a meaningless survey. Consisting of multiple questions with answers as radiobuttons. Ranging from 0 (the worst) to 5 (the best).
In this automatic script, made by Selenium Webdriver you can choose the range of your answers (e.g. 4-5) and then fill out all of the 50+ questions within a seconds.
